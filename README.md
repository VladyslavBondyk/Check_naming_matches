# Check_naming_matches
Code which can help u check whether ur files on ur machine are matching with the list of names u provovided. This code its just created for my own use in internal client's project. The only line need to be changed specifically on ur demand â€“ line 11 and line 16. 
BTW the output will show the names. (from ur list u provided) which are not matched with the files from the folder.
